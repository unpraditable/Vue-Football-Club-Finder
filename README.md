# Vue-Football-Club-Finder
Football Club Finder created with Vue JS framework. People can search it based on the area (countries) and competitions

## Project setup
First, clone this project via https:
```
git clone https://github.com/unpraditable/Vue-Football-Club-Finder.git
```
After you clone it, navigate to the folder where you clone the project, then change it to the vue-football-club-finder-directory (careful, there is a child directory which has the same name as parent directory, the difference is the parent directory has capital letters "Vue-Football-Club-Finder-Directory")
```
cd vue-football-club-finder
```

Then, install all dependencies in this folder
```
npm install
```

After that, you can run this project
```
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Extra Works
1. Separate the continents into the main area at the homepage. I think it is necessary to limit the number of country.
2. Show only the continents/area that has a country, because I think it will be helpful for user.

### Testing Environment (in General)
So far, this project runs well with latest version of Google Chrome and Safari browser. Opened in MacBook Air with FirstMedia internet connection.
